    <p> The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
        It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat
        to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
        A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.
        Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
        About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.
    </p>
    <p> The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth,
        and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey.
        Its night vision and sense of smell are well-developed.
        Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well
        as cat-specific body language.
        A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species.
        It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.
        Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.
    </p>
    <p>Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.
        Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy
        Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets
        has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.
    </p>
    <p> It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC,
        but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication occurred in Western Asia around 7500 BC.
    </p>
    <p> As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.
        As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and
        around 42 million households own at least one cat.
        In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.

    <p>
        The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus,
        which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.
        It was suggested that cattus is derived from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau, 'tomcat', or its feminine form suffixed with -t.
        The Late Latin word may be derived from another Afro-Asiatic or Nilo-Saharan language.
        The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.
        The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, it is "equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word,
        imported into Latin and thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic".
        The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf.
        Northern Sami gáđfi, 'female stoat', and Hungarian hölgy, 'lady, female stoat'; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä, 'female (of a furred animal)'.
    </p>
    <p>
        The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced
        from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt.
        Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín.
        The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.
    </p>
    <p>
        A male cat is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered).
        A female is called a queen (or a molly, if spayed), especially in a cat-breeding context.
        A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten.
        In Early Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling.
        A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder or a glaring.

        The scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat.
        Felis catus domesticus was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777.
        Felis daemon proposed by Konstantin Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the Transcaucasus,
        later identified as a domestic cat.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct species,
        namely Felis catus.
        In 2007, it was considered a subspecies, F. silvestris catus, of the European wildcat (F. silvestris)
        following results of phylogenetic research.
        In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce followed the recommendation of the ICZN in regarding the domestic cat as a distinct species,
        Felis catus.

        The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 10–15 million years ago.
        The genus Felis diverged from other Felidae around 6–7 million years ago.
        Results of phylogenetic research confirm that the wild Felis species evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation,
        whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.
        The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genes.
        The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BC.
        This line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today.

        A cat eating a fish under a chair, a mural in an Egyptian tomb dating to the 15th century BC
        The earliest known indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was excavated close by a
        human Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500–7200 BC.
        Since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most
        likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the Middle Eastern mainland.
        Scientists therefore assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the Fertile Crescent by rodents,
        in particular the house mouse (Mus musculus), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers.
        This mutual relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years.
        As agricultural practices spread, so did tame and domesticated cats.
        Wildcats of Egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time.

        The earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in Greece dates to around 1200 BC.
        Greek, Phoenician, Carthaginian and Etruscan traders introduced domestic cats to southern Europe.
        During the Roman Empire they were introduced to Corsica and Sardinia before the beginning of the 1st millennium.
        By the 5th century BC, they were familiar animals around settlements in Magna Graecia and Etruria.
        By the end of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a Baltic Sea port in northern Germany.

        During domestication, cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior, and they are still capable of surviving in the wild.
        Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have pre-adapted them for domestication as pets.
        These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play, and high intelligence.
        Captive Leopardus cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans but were not domesticated.
        House cats often mate with feral cats.
        Hybridisation between domestic and other Felinae species is also possible, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat in Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
        Development of cat breeds started in the mid 19th century.
        An analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in the
        process of domestication, as specific mutations were selected to develop cat breeds.
        Most breeds are founded on random-bred domestic cats. Genetic diversity of these breeds varies between regions,
        and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than 20 deleterious genetic disorders.
