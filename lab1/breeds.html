            <b>#1 Persian</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Easily one of the most recognised and popular breed of cat is the Persian. This breed actually has a very old history where they have been at the centre of civilization since they were first introduced into Europe in the 17th century. Up until the late 19th century the breeding of cats with long hair from Turkey, Afghanistan and Persia were classified as Asiatic cats and were commonly bred together. Today they have been bred to keep their very unique look which is a round head, short face, snub nose, chubby cheeks, rounded ears and big eyes.

            <b>#2 Maine Coon</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The Maine Coon is a native New England breed that hailed from Maine. They were a very popular farm cat, mouser and most likely a ship cat up until the early 19th century. This breed is very good natured and adapts well too many different lifestyles and personalities. They like people being around them but they aren’t necessarily clingy. The mouser trait has still been passed down for many generations so expect your home to be rodent free.

            <b>#3 Ragdoll</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Ragdolls are very smart and with enough positive reinforcement can quickly pick up tricks and good habits such as scratching posts. This particular breed is fairly new compared to the other breeds as it was first developed by a breeder in the 1960s. They love people and like what their name suggests they simply collapse in your arms when you pick them up. Even if they are cradled on their back, they love a good cuddle and scratch from anyone. They generally stay on the same level as people rather than being at the highest point in the room.

            <b>#4 Siamese</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The Siamese cat is the pinnacle of sophistication as they look like they are all dressed up for a masquerade ball. If you live in an apartment or house that doesn’t allow for pets good luck trying to hide a Siamese as they are very talkative and opinionated. While they are extremely fond of people, they will definitely tell you what they are thinking in a very loud and raspy tone and expect you to wait on them when the call. They do require attention and play time so if you are on the go all the time this may not be the right breed for you.

        <dd>
            The British shorthair is iconic in pop culture being the breed that was featured as puss in boots from Shrek and the Cheshire Cat of Alice in Wonderland. It is obliviously an English breed and has been the pinnacle of the pedigree since the Victorian era. They are very mellow and easy going making them a wonderful addition to any family. They love some affection but doesn’t whinge non-stop when you don’t give them love for 2 seconds.

            <b>#6 Exotic Shorthair</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
            The Exotic shorthair is similar to the Persian breed but with a different coat. They were first bred in the 1950s by cross breeding Persians with American shorthairs. They were then bred with Burmese and Russian Blue breeds before going back to Persian once they had a short coat. The result was a breed with the same features and personality of the Persian but with an easy to care for coat. Due to their pedigree breeding they do come with a lot of health concerns relating to their face.

            While most cats love to sleep and laze around, the Abyssinian lives life to the max. They climb higher, jump further and play harder than their other brethren. They are a very intelligent breed which makes them both an entertaining and challenging pet to have. Abby Grabby is the nickname given to this breed as they are known for taking anything that grabs their attention. If you do plan on getting an Aby be sure to have a tonne of toys on hand as they love to play!

            Tonk cats are very friendly, loving and active pets to have. While you may generally think of cats as being independent and aloof, you definitely haven’t met a Tonk before.

They will follow you around the house, join in on family activities and will simply sit on your shoulder given the chance.

            The Russian Blue is elegant, gentle and quiet breed that loves to play. They love to climb and jump up to high places where they can watch over their humans and study them from afar. Guests won’t receive their immediate attention as they prefer to assess the situation before they get involved with complete strangers. But to their favourite people they are super loyal and will follow you around and ride on your shoulder.

            Bengals are the athletes of cat breeds being agile, graceful, strong with a very muscular body. They are high active and intelligent which means it is common for them to pick up a number of tricks and games. Bengals are a very confident, friendly and talkative breed that is alert to everything.

        <dd>
            Named after their adorably folded ears, the Scottish Fold loves nothing more than being cuddled up with people and being a part of whatever they are doing. After you get past their very noticeable ears you will find that they love to zone out in some very weird positions including but not limited to the meerkat pose or being sprawled across the ground. They are a very smart breed that loves teaser toys that test their agility.

        <dd>
            The long haired Siberian cat originates all the way from Russia where the cold, forested area definitely contributed to their coat. While their homeland is cold, their hearts are very warm and love to be around people and follow them around. If you need help reading while you are on the toilet you can be sure that the Siberian cat will be there to assist you. Getting their fur combed while sitting in your lap may be their favourite thing in the entire world.

They don’t tend to like strangers or loud situations. They are sedate creatures that prefer a nice serene environment where they can be petted by their family.

            The very gentle and friendly Norwegian Forest cat is very fond of family members and doesn’t need constant attention and petting. They are satisfied if they are in the same room as people and are happy to entertain themselves when no one is home. While they appreciate human company, they can be a bit reserved with strangers and guests to the home. They aren’t really a lap cat sort of breed even with family members but won’t turn down the chance for a good scratch between the ears.

            The very lively and affectionate Bombay cats love people and are very adaptable to many different lifestyles. Their calm nature makes them great for apartments and are more than happy to hang around with a couple of other friendly cats.

They are always up for a chat with their owner but won’t scream at you when you are trying to communicate.

            These energetic and friendly cats are very smart and do crave attention from others. That attention can be from other pets so if your household is empty for long periods of time with no one else home you may want to consider a different breed. In saying that they get along very well with other cats and dogs but another Burmese cat will be his best friend above all.
